The dataset includes 2210 images.
Crop- are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 512x512 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
